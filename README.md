# Simon Game

This is a game where colored lights will be lit in an order, and the player must recreate the same order.

It starts with one light in the pattern, and goes up to 8. If you can recreate all 8 in the right order, you win the game. Even if you lose, you can play again!

Pay close attention to the lights while the sequence is playing!
